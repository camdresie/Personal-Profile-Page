        <h2>It All Began With Recruiting...</h2>
        <p>After I graduated from law school, I joined a large tech recruiting company to help them build out a legal recruiting vertical. That was my first exposure to different tech stacks and skillsets. I worked with a few tech candidates in my time there and became interested in full stack web development and big data.</p>
        <p>After leaving that position, I had developed a hunger to learn more about technology and code. I'm finally pursuing the next steps in fulfilling that hunger by beginning with a strong frontend skillset at Treehouse!</p>

        <h2>My Areas of Greatest Interest</h2>
        <p>Below is a list of technologies that I would like to learn eventually:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>MongoDB</li>
          <li>Hadoop</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I know these skills are diverse, but I'm committed to learning them over the long haul. I'm confident that with enough tenacity, all of my goals will be accomplished!</p>
